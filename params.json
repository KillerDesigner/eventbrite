{"name":"Eventbrite","body":"eventbrite\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis gem is no longer actively maintained, though I do try to fix any reported\r\nbugs. For a more official gem, see: https://github.com/ryanjarvinen/eventbrite-client.rb\r\n\r\nA simple library for integrating with EventBrite's API. Requires the \"httparty\" gem \r\nfor connecting and doing XML parsing, and \"tzinfo\" gem for getting back and forth \r\nbetween timezone names and GMT offsets.\r\n\r\nThe gem was recently renamed from Eventbright - since that was\r\na confusing name. \r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n    require 'eventbrite'\r\n    Eventbrite.setup(\"APP_KEY\")\r\n    user = Eventbrite::User.new(\"USER_KEY\") #=> <Eventbrite::User >\r\n    user.venues #=> [<Eventbrite::Venue>,...] # Venues the user has defined\r\n\r\n\r\nSome basic (yardoc generated) documentation availabe at: http://therabidbanana.github.com/eventbrite/\r\n\r\nThis library attempts to create an almost ActiveResource like wrapper\r\naround the Eventbrite api. The following objects are available:\r\n\r\n* Attendee (can only be viewed, not edited)\r\n* Discount\r\n* Event (has many Tickets, Attendees, Discounts, has one Venue and\r\n  one Organizer)\r\n* Organizer (has many Events)\r\n* Ticket\r\n* User (has many Events, Organizers, Venues)\r\n* Venue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthentication\r\n--------------\r\nMany methods require user authentication. For these methods, you can pass a user object as an authentication token, and the user's api_key will automatically be used for the request. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n    \r\n    Eventbrite::Event.new({\"x\" => \"y\"... , \"user\" => user})\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n----------\r\n\r\n1. This library's testing coverage is almost zero. \r\n2. There is no subuser support.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Note About App Keys\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThis gem has an application key for accessing EventBrite, but each app key is limited to 30,000 requests a day. To make sure your limits aren't affected by others, you should register for your own app key specific to the application you're adding the gem to. \r\n\r\nIf you just want to give the gem a whirl (you have to wait for approval to get your own) just don't call setup. The app key for the gem will be used.\r\n\r\nLearn more about EventBrite's App Key policy here: [Terms of Service](http://www.eventbrite.com/api/terms)\r\n\r\nRegister for your own app key here: [Request a Key](http://www.eventbrite.com/api/key/)\r\n\r\n\r\nAPI Gotchas \r\n------------\r\n\r\nThere are some sticky points to the Eventbrite api this library helps with - read the details at: http://therabidbanana.github.com/eventbrite/file.ImplementationGotchas.html\r\n\r\n\r\nNote on Patches/Pull Requests\r\n-----------------------------\r\n \r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a\r\n  future version unintentionally.\r\n* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.\r\n  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)\r\n* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2010 David Haslem.
